    "descriptionLong": "The development goal is to design the Sky Blueprint to be modular and reusable, enabling seamless integration into any scene by simply dragging the actor into the level. I created a Sky Blueprint containing key components such as Directional Light, Sky Atmosphere, Skylight (enabled real time capture), Exponential Height Fog, and Post-Process Volume to establish foundational lighting. I also configured a global Post-Process Volume to disable auto exposure, ensuring consistent lighting for both day and night scenes.",
